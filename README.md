# Todo App

This is a solution to the [Planet facts site challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/planets-fact-site-gazqN8w_f). I have been provided with a Figma sketch, assets such as icons and images, and a README file explaining the challenge. All the code and functionality is written from scratch by me 😊

## The challenge 📝

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   View each planet page and toggle between "Overview", "Internal Structure", and "Surface Geology"

## What I learned 👩‍🎓

For me, the main learning opportunities in this project was:

1. Trying out Next.js
2. Practicing transforming a Figma sketch to an actual app

### Next.js

This is the first time that I'm making a complete app (a small one but still) in Next.js and I really enjoyed working with it! Since I had all the data locally in a json file I decided to go with a static site, but it's gonna be interesting to work with server side rendering in the future! :) I'm also completely blown away of how easy deployment with Vercel was! It's literally done with the click of a button, and I will for sure use Vercel for future projects.

### Layout

This was a very fun challenge design-wise because the views for mobile, tablet and desktop was quite different! Not a whole lot, but take a look at the menu for example. It differs quite a lot on different sizes, and it was so much fun to write the code for it - lots and lots of pseudoclasses :P

## Continued development ✏️

It would be fun to find an API that could provide even more data about space. Perhaps users should be able to search for a certain planet? I really loved the space theme, the images and the font pairings in this challenge - it looks great!
